# Haskell Calculator
### Overview
This is a simple calculator program written in `Haskell` and can be run using the  `Stack` tool. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition `(+)`, subtraction `(-)`, multiplication `(*)`, and division `(/)`. The calculator takes user input for two numbers and the operation to perform, then displays the result.



1. Generate new stack project
```
stack new project-name
```
2. Build the project
